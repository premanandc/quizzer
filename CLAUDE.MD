## General Rules

1. Discuss the plan (specifically test scenarios) with me before writing code.
2. Write self-documenting code using expressive names and short methods.
3. Avoid overly long and excessively nested functions/methods.
4. Use a functional programming style where possible.
5. Practice test-driven development at all time.
6. Run tests before and after making changes to verify functionality.
7. Look for refactoring opportunities before making code changes.
